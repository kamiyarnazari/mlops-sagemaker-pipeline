# MLOps SageMaker Pipeline with AWS CDK

This project implements a full end-to-end **MLOps pipeline** using **AWS SageMaker**, **CDK (Python)**, and other AWS services. It is designed both as a **learning project** and a **portfolio-level demonstration** of real-world cloud ML engineering.

---

## 🧱 What This Project Does

- 📦 Define infrastructure using **AWS CDK (Python)**
- 🪣 Set up S3 buckets for raw and processed data
- 🛡️ Create IAM roles for SageMaker processing and training jobs
- ⚙️ Launch **SageMaker Training Jobs** (e.g., XGBoost)
- 🧪 Evaluate and register models in **SageMaker Model Registry**
- 🚀 Deploy models to **real-time SageMaker Endpoints**
- 🔁 Automate the pipeline with **CodePipeline + CodeBuild**
- 📊 Monitor logs and metrics using **CloudWatch**

---

## 🧠 Learning Objectives

This repository is built as a **MLOps masterclass** project, focusing on:

- Deep understanding of AWS MLOps architecture
- Infrastructure-as-Code with CDK
- End-to-end ML lifecycle automation
- CI/CD for retraining and redeployment
- Monitoring deployed ML models in production

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **AWS CDK (Python)**
- **SageMaker**: Processing, Training, Model Registry, Endpoint
- **S3**: Data and model storage
- **IAM**: Role-based permissions
- **CloudWatch**: Logging and monitoring
- **CodePipeline + CodeBuild** (CI/CD - coming soon)
